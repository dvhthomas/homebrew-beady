  caveats do
    <<~EOS
      Beady is ad-hoc signed but not notarised (there is no Apple Developer ID
      behind it), so macOS quarantines the download. The first launch is refused;
      System Settings > Privacy & Security then offers "Open Anyway", and that
      approval is kept across upgrades. To clear the flag yourself instead:

        xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/Beady.app"

      Beady drives bd, which it looks for on PATH and in Homebrew's bin:

        brew install beads
    EOS
  end
end
